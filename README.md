# Bank Marketing Data Analysis and Predictive Modeling

This repository contains the code and resources for a data analysis and predictive modeling project focused on a bank's marketing campaigns. The project aims to analyze the bank's historical marketing data and develop a predictive model to identify potential customers who are likely to subscribe to a term deposit. Additionally, the project provides insights into the challenges faced during the analysis and modeling process.

## Project Overview

The project is divided into three main tasks:

1. **Data Analysis Report**: A comprehensive analysis of the provided bank marketing dataset, exploring various attributes and their relationships.

2. **Predictive Model**: Development of a predictive model using machine learning algorithms to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit based on their characteristics.

3. **Challenges Faced**: A detailed report on the challenges encountered during the data analysis and modeling process, along with the techniques used to overcome them.

## Project Structure

- `bank-additional-full.csv`: Directory containing the dataset used for analysis and modeling.
- `notebooks`: Jupyter notebooks for each project task.
    - `Data Analysis.ipynb`: Notebook containing the data analysis report.
    - `Predictive Modeling.ipynb`: Notebook with the implementation of the predictive model.
    - `Challenges Faced.ipynb`: Notebook discussing challenges faced and solutions applied.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Dataset

The project utilizes the bank marketing dataset, which includes various attributes related to customers and their interactions with the bank's marketing campaigns. The dataset can be accessed [here](https://d3ilbtxij3aepc.cloudfront.net/projects/CDS-Capstone-Projects/PRCP-1000-ProtugeseBank.zip).
